What is Data Science?

Computer Science
Math
Operation research

Applied Science

Data Scientist

-Data Gathering
-Analysis
-Decision Making 

Future prediction
Finding patterns
By Analysing

1.Better decisions (A or B)
2.Predictive analysis(What will happen next ?)
3.Pattern Discoveries (Find pattern , Or hidden pattern)

Industries:

Banking
Healthcare
Manufacturing (Car, Phone etc...)

Ship Navigation(Finding the new route)
To Foresee the flight delay / Ship / Train
To predict the election reports
To find the revenue of the company 
Stock market 
E commerce 


Data scientist :

Machine learning
Programming (Python/R)
database (sql, mongodb, cassandra)
Math 
Stat

Data: Collection of any information 

Structured Data
Un Structured Data

Where to start?
1.Learning the prgmg lang to handle the data
2.Which is the most widely used language / Optimal way to achieve the output

Python:

Why python ?

1.Saving the time
2.Easy to write and manage
3.It is useful in web devlopment(Django & Flask ) and Machine Learning (Tensorflow, Opencv etc..)
4.Open source 
5.Allow the third party libraries


Day 1 


Intro to python 
Math Module 
Data types

1. Intro to python 

-Python 3.x
-Syntax Rules
-Hello World
-Numbers and Math Functions
-Variables

Downloading & Installing python :

Go to www.python.org/downloads/  
Download Python as per your system requirement  
Installing python on windows  
1. Click on Python Releases for Windows, select the link 
for the latest Python3 Release – Python 3.x.x  
2. Scroll to the bottom and select either Windows x86-64 
executable Installer for 64-bit or Windows x86 
executable installer for 32-bit  

python
Pip (Package Management system)


Data Types

1.String
2.Lists
3.Tuple
4.Set
5.Dictionaries
6.Array

1. Every Value has a data type
2. a=5 

b = "Test"
type()

1.Strings:

-'' or ""
b = "Test" / b = 'Test'

Eg: "This is jay's note"

a='This is jay's note'

print(a)
Ans:
a='This is jay\'s note'
print(a)

2.List :
[] and , 

x=["stu1","stu2","stu3"]

3.Tuple:

() and , 

y=("p1","p2","p3")

4.Set:
{} and ,
z= {"t1","t2","t3"}

5.Dictionaries:
{} , : for assiging the values

a={"Name" : "John", "Age":}
